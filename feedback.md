# Check back for my feedback and comments often. 


## Initial Feedback 12-10-2017

- there are a lot of packages required for this which is fine except you really should automate the install of them first
- I will look at the app more when you automate this part. 



## Feedback 12-12

- App layout looks good. 
- Still wont run properly without me having to install a lot of packages.

#### We have addressed this feedback (12-12) should be working now

### What your Classmates liked

-
- not presented
- Which app was this?
- Very practical use for real life problems. Checks to see if input options are logical. Options to have the same graph using different inputs. Ability to move the 3d scatterplot graph 
- This app is very important for health reasons; the graphs look nice and are intuitive to use for physicians and everyone.
- I like the idea of relating the paper and the shiny app. It displays the relation stated in the paper visually.
- The graphs can be moved. That's really impressive.
- really cool graphics/visualization - my favorite was the population risk plot, i like that you also - included all the data and information that might be of interest to some users
- What I like most is the 3-dimensional plot. It looks great. And you can also zoom in and change the direction to look at it. Also the graph in the beginning can tell the audience where to improve and become healthier.
- I liked the topic chosen and the way it was carried out
- visualizations, and idea  
- Amazing visuals, particularly the 3D visual model
- My group project
- "The app is very professional and useful on analyze CVD risk.
- Show a spinning ""loading"" animation while a plot is recalculating。
3D graph is very cool."
- "- I like the idea!
- The main plot and the 3D cholesterol graph are very visually appealing. "
- The graph looks really nice. I like the public health angle.
- I really like the 3D graph part.
- "Could not run the app with following error: ""here is no package called ‘glue’
- Warning: Error in : package or namespace load failed for ‘plotly’
- Error : package or namespace load failed for ‘plotly’"
- Good idea.
- N/A
- This one was insane, the 3D graph was awesome and the risk calculator was something I want to use 
- Graphs present very good visualizations
- Good app for those are at risk of developing heart disease. Good use of 3-D graph
- N/A - One of the author of this app
- that they provided a description, the advanced code, the 
- This is an amazing app. It's practical and it has a lot of theoretical support behind it. The graphics are fancy.


### What your classmates suggest to change

- Add units for risk of developing CVD for simulation population risk
- Instead of non-BMI, labeling it as cholesterol would be helpful instead. Other than that, the interface and everything looks great and is easy to understand.
- I think the app could add some introduction. For example, it could state that which data did it use and how the data were measured in the paper.
- Nothing.
- i'm not sure... I thought this app was very well done!
- For the personal information, for example it can set the smoking part to be different frequency level.
- I think more explanations should be put in so that the user can follow along
able to use population function 
- Maybe add in a function that helps the user identify which category of their health is the easiest for them to target in order to maintain a healthier heart
- My group project
- Add more comments in the code.
"- In the tab “individual risk”, it might be useful to include an action button so that the app doesn’t update every time one input is changed
- In the “About” table, I think there should be a clear message about the limitations of the risk calculator so that people don’t get scared about their scores."
- Maybe change the radar graph so that it reacts a bit more to changes in values
- Some numbers are too dense in graphs.
- reduce runtime for the app, add function for checking and loading the required packages 
- Instruction?
- N/A
- Describe the axis of the 3D plot within a help text on the side bar. 3D plots can ve confusing so maybe just saying where the most at risk (right corner) would be located is nice.
- A better introduction of all the functions of the app
- Include introduction tab and need explanations for the results 
- N/A - One of the author of this app
- the workflow could be improved and it could automate package downloading. It also took quite a bit of time to download all the package. It makes me think that it could be simplified. 
- I cannot think of a way to improve this app.


### Changes before turning this in

- Comment your code more
- Add more of an introduction to what this does, use screenshots to help aid with the explanation. 
- Make sure all graphs are labeled
